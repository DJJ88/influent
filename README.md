# influent

Influent is a new web based application for visually and interactively following transaction flow, revealing actors and behaviors of potential concern that might otherwise go unnoticed. Summary visualization of transactional patterns and actor characteristics, interactive link expansion and dynamic entity clustering enable Influent to operate effectively at scale with big data sources, in any modern web browser. Influent has been used to explore data sets with millions of entities and hundreds of millions of transactions.

Highlighted transactions are shown for entities of interest (B). Click [+] buttons to expand incoming/outgoing entity links (C). “Unstack” clusters of entities by clicking paperclip to drill down (D). Specify transaction filter (E).
