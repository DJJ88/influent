Influent is an HTML5 tool for visually and interactively following transaction flow, rapidly revealing actors and behaviors of potential concern that might otherwise go unnoticed. Summary visualization of transactional patterns and actor characteristics, interactive link expansion and dynamic entity clustering enable Influent to operate effectively at scale with big data sources, in any modern web browser. Influent has been used to explore data sets with millions of entities and hundreds of millions of transactions.
